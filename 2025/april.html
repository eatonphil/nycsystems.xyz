    <h1>April 17th, 2025 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the second night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Ben Hindman and Stephanie Wang speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the last two decades, backends have evolved from simple
      monoliths to complex distributed systems, incorporating
      microservices, serverless functions, multiple databases, event
      queues, and more. These architectures improve scalability and
      modularity at the cost of significant complexity in managing
      data consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even without the extra complications in the backend, the
      inherently distributed nature of the frontend and the backend
      was already complicated enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ll present a new programming model for building full-stack
      distributed systems, Reboot, that unifies application logic with
      data management. The programming model relies on built-in
      primitives for reactivity, atomicity, and idempotency that
      dramatically simplify development without sacrificing safety or
      scalability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of thinking in tables and rows in a database, developers
      think in data structures and functions, and the programming
      model provides a well-defined semantics for how those functions
      can be composed safely together.

    <h2>Small but Mighty: Why simple systems still win (even in the age of AI)</h2>

    <p>
      Stephanie is a Staff Engineer at MongoDB, where she focuses on
      designing and building scalable, high-performance database
      systems. Previously, she was a founding engineer at MotherDuck,
      where she played a key role in shaping its cloud-native
      analytics platform built on DuckDB. Prior to that, she worked on
      Google BigQuery, specializing in BigQuery client libraries and
      connectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stephanie is passionate about developing solutions that enhance
      performance, scalability, and usability. She is particularly
      interested in the challenges of cloud-native data systems and ensuring
      that complex infrastructure remains robust and efficient.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      You’ve got 100K documents and a mandate to “do AI”. Do you need
      a real-time distributed vector database on Kubernetes? Probably
      not.
    </p>

    <p>
      This talk is about the systems we overbuild, the complexity we
      inherit, and why most problems don’t need distributed
      infrastructure – at least not yet. Through the lens of semantic
      search (and some spicy anti-patterns), we’ll explore how to
      scale right: by building a single-node system so good, scaling
      out later isn’t a rewrite, it’s just a rollout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because sometimes the fastest way to go big… is to start small
      and actually get it right.

    <h1>June 18th, 2025 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the third night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Haikal Ryclova-Pribadi + Joshua Send and
      Joe Cutler speak, and glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner
      for the venue.
    </p>

    <h2>Validating and Optimizing Database Queries with Types</h2>

    <p>
      Haikal is a computer scientist and the Founder and CEO of
      TypeDB. His work began in robotics in collaboration with NASA
      JPL, and at the University of Cambridge. Today, Haikal and his
      team in London work on building TypeDB: a new database that
      brings the power of programming languages to the database.

      Joshua is the Head of Engineering at TypeDB. He started his
      journey in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, and
      continued to work on building TypeDB, and lead the development
      of TypeDB 3.0.

      It can be very easy to write bugs in SQL or NoSQL queries as
      they get complex, as databases are not yet as good at validating
      correctness as a programming languages do.
    </p>

    <p>
      As programmers, we're used to reaching for strongly typed
      languages when correctness and performance are paramount, but
      databases have no such option. By introducing types in database
      query languages, we found ourselves catching entirely new classes
      of query issues, including semantic ones, as well as inefficient
      possible query plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      By leveraging principles from a modern branch of mathematics,
      Type Theory, we were able to introduce a rich and highly
      expressive type system, bringing the benefits of programming
      languages to the database. User-defined types, variables,
      functions, sophisticated type checking, and much more, now
      become available to us at the database.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will share with you in this talk, how we blend programming
      language design, compiler technology, and more traditional
      database operations, to build the ultimate database for
      programmers.

    <h2>Fail Faster: Staging and Fast Randomness for High-Performance Property-Based Testing</h2>

    <img class="profile" src="/assets/jcutler.jpg" />

    <p>
      Joe Cutler is a 5th year PhD student at the University of
      Pennsylvania, advised by Benjamin Pierce. Joe does research in
      programming languages and compilers, usually focused on topics
      related to type systems or functional programming. Outside of
      work, Joe spends far too much time running.

    <p>
      Property-based testing (PBT) relies on generators of random test
      cases. The effectiveness of PBT depends critically on the speed
      of these generators: the faster data is generated, the faster
      properties can fail, and the faster bugs can be found. However,
      careful measurements show that the generator performance of
      widely used PBT libraries falls well short of what is possible,
      due principally to (1) the abstraction overhead of their
      combinator-heavy style and (2) suboptimal sources of
      randomness. We characterize, quantify, and address these
      bottlenecks.
    </p>

    <p>
      To eliminate abstraction overheads, we propose a technique based
      on multi-stage programming, dubbed Allegro. We apply this
      technique to leading generator libraries in OCaml and Scala 3,
      significantly improving performance. To quantify the performance
      impact of the randomness source, we carry out a controlled
      experiment, replacing the randomness in the OCaml PBT library
      with an optimized version. Both interventions exactly preserve
      the semantics of generators, enabling precise, pointwise
      comparisons. Together, these improvements find bugs up to 13Ã—
      faster in our benchmark suite.

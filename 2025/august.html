    <h1>June 18th, 2025 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the third night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Haikal Vahab Jabrayilov and
      Oz Katz speak, and glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner
      for the venue.
    </p>

    <h2>Achieving Bare Metal Performance in the Cloud</h2>

    <p>
      Vahab Jabrayilov is a Computer Science PhD student at Columbia
      University, advised by Professor Kostis Kaffes. He specializes
      in performance optimization for computer systems, focusing on
      designing scheduling solutions across end-host, rack, and
      cluster scales to minimize microsecond-scale tail latency. More
      recently, his work has expanded to include accelerating machine
      learning systems.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      Modern cloud applications need microsecond-level responsiveness,
      yet current virtualization approaches often cause
      millisecond-scale delays. This talk presents two complementary
      solutions that bring virtualized environments closer to
      bare-metal performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, Machnet is a userspace network stack designed for public
      clouds. Rather than relying on specialized NIC features
      unavailable in virtual NICs, Machnet uses a “Least Common
      Denominator” approach and a microkernel design to support
      flexible execution models. It achieves substantial latency and
      CPU efficiency gains, demonstrating 80% lower latency and 75%
      lower CPU utilization for a key-value store compared to today’s
      best solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, Rorke is a microsecond-scale VM scheduler for
      oversubscribed cloud environments. By approximating processor
      sharing at the host and dynamically adapting time slices, Rorke
      cuts tail latency by over 10× for popular low-latency
      workloads—without harming throughput in non-oversubscribed
      scenarios. Together, Rorke and Machnet bring virtualized
      infrastructure closer than ever to bare-metal levels of
      performance, setting a new standard for cloud computing
      efficiency.

    <h2>Git Semantics, Data Lake Scale: Fast Branching Over Billions of Objects</h2>

    <img class="profile" src="/assets/ozkatz.jpeg" />

    <p>
      Oz Katz is the CTO and co-founder of lakeFS, the open source
      platform bringing Git-like version control to petabyte-scale data
      lakes. Previously, Oz led Data and Infrastructure as VP R&D at
      SimilarWeb (NYSE: SMWB), scaling systems to handle internet-wide
      analytics. Oz joined SimilarWeb through its acquisition of Swayy, a
      content analytics startup he co-founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      With deep expertise in distributed systems and data
      infrastructure, Oz is passionate about making data and AI
      engineering as agile and collaborative as software development.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      In Git, branching is instant and merging scales with your
      changes - not the size of your repository.  Now imagine those
      same guarantees applied to petabytes of data and billions of
      objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk shows how lakeFS brings Git-like semantics to massive
      data lakes, delivering constant-time branching and atomic
      commits directly on cloud object storage.  We'll dive into the
      metadata structures, commit algorithms, and concurrency controls
      that make it possible - as well as examine the trade-offs and
      engineering decisions behind achieving "Git-speed" at planetary
      scale.

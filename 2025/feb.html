    <h1>February 20nd, 2025 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the first night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Arun Parthiban and Justin Moore speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.

    <h2>Optimizing Query Performance with Materialized Views at Datadog</h2>

    <p>
      Arun Parthiban is a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, working on the
      Cross-Product Queries team, where he builds query systems for
      Datadog's storage infrastructure. Previously, he was part of
      Datadog's Task Platform team, developing queues and schedulers.

      Delivering a great customer experience requires fast, responsive
      user interfaces, which depend on low-latency query responses
      from data systems. As a result, optimizing query performance is
      a key priority for engineering teams. Various techniques can
      help achieve this, including query optimization, precomputing
      results, and caching data in memory or storage. One powerful
      approach is Materialized Views. In this talk, we’ll explore
      Datadog’s Materialized Views infrastructure and how it enhances
      query performance while keeping costs low.

    <h2>Experiences with Semi-Formal Proofs</h2>

    <p>
      Justin Moore is the Head of Infrastructure
      at <a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a>, and is
      responsible for designing, deploying, and maintaining the cloud
      environments and core infrastructure services for the Antithesis
      platform. Over the last 25 years his career has spanned
      datacenter efficiency, civics and elections, and sports
      analytics.

    <p>
      Ensuring the correctness and security of infrastructure placed
      on the open internet is challenging to get right and easy to get
      wrong. Traditional code reviews can be insufficient to fully
      address this problem, while formal proofs of correctness can be
      complicated, time-consuming, and overkill. In this talk I will
      discuss our approach and experience of using semi-formal proof
      methods paired with modern programming language features to
      mitigate risks in the services which comprise our "virtual
      Trusted Computing Base".

    <h1>June 20, 2024 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the third night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Sujay Jayakar and Dan Harris speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
    </p>

    <h2>Elegant Full Text Search</h2>

    <p>
      Sujay is Chief Scientist and Co-founder at Convex, which means
      he writes a lot of code, helps ensure everything fits together
      elegantly, and comes up with wacky ideas for the future. He
      previously worked at Dropbox, working on backend infrastructure
      and desktop client file synchronization, and did a brief stint
      at Microsoft Research, where he worked on microsecond scale
      kernel bypass networking. Come talk to him about data
      structures, programming languages, and highly curated small food
      goods.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      As systems developers, we’re often scared of full text search
      and systems like Elasticsearch or Vespa. They’re often
      impenetrable black boxes of complex natural language rules,
      machine learning based heuristics, and sophisticated query
      planners. In this talk, I’d like to convince you that there are
      just a few core algorithms and data structures behind full text
      search and that these ideas are quite elegant.

    <h2>Scalable analytics on dynamic, semi-structured data</h2>

    <p>
      Dan Harris is a Principal Software Engineer at Coralogix working
      on making sense of observability data
      at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">web
      scale</a>.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      Columnar storage and memory formats such as parquet and Apache
      Arrow have proved their mettle when building OLAP systems but
      have some severe trade-offs when representing highly dynamic,
      semi-structured data. In this talk I will give a brief overview
      of the problem space and how we solved it at Coralogix while
      building a petabyte-scale OLAP engine.

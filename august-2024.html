    <h1>August 15, 2024 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the fourth night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Jonathon Belotti and Sam Arch speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
    </p>

    <p>RSVP <a href="https://forms.gle/E3ryLdfyQXYssNF87">here</a>.</p>

    <p>
      Jonathon Belotti is a software engineer at Modal Labs working on
      its multi-tenant container runtime specialized for generative AI
      applications. Prior to moving to Modal, he led ML Platform and
      banged on build systems at Canva in Sydney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work he's on his best behavior so they don't send him
      back to Australia.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      In this talk Jonathon will show how low serverless 'cold starts'
      can get with FUSE, NVMe disks, and public cloud blob storage
      services. He'll take you through the high-level before getting
      into the performance grind of mount option configuration,
      caching, prefetching, and file system selection.

    <h2>Dear UDFs, I Broke Up With You, But Now I'm Ready To Give You A Second Chance. Will You Take Me Back? Sincerely, SQL</h2>

    <p>
      Sam is a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Carnegie
      Mellon University, co-advised by Prof. Andy Pavlo and Prof. Todd
      Mowry. Sam's research interests are at the intersection of
      compilers and database systems, with a specific focus on
      improving the performance of SQL queries that invoke
      user-defined functions (UDFs). Before starting grad school, Sam
      worked as a Compiler Engineer at Apple, where he helped ship
      Metal-accelerated rendering in Blender 3.1. Before that, Sam
      completed his undergraduate degree at The University of Sydney,
      Australia.

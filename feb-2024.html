    <h1>February 22nd, 2024 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the first night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Paul Butler and Stefan Karpinski speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you plan to attend, please RSVP below!
    </p>

    <h2>You Might Not Need a CRDT: Document Sync in the Wild</h2>

    <img class="profile" src="https://paulbutler.org/images/paul.jpg" />

    <p>
      <a href="https://paulbutler.org">Paul</a> is a co-founder of
      <a href="https://jamsocket.com">Jamsocket</a>, which provides
      infrastructure for scaling WebSocket services. He also writes the
      <a href="https://digest.browsertech.com">Browsertech
	Digest</a>. Prior to that, he was a quant at Two Sigma and an
      engineer at Google.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are a family of data
      structure commonly associated with the real-time state
      synchronization functionality of applications like Google Docs and
      Figma, neither of which actually use CRDTs!
    </p>

    <p>
      Paul will explain the basics of CRDTs, when they are useful, and
      what people use instead when they arenâ€™t.
    </p>

    <h1>October 17, 2024 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the fifth night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series! Talks are agnostic of language, framework, operating
      system, etc. And they are focused on engineering challenges, not
      product pitches.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to have Andrew Werner and  speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
    </p>

    <p>RSVP <a href="https://forms.gle/XDNCuurRy7HKmoiT7">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Userspace dynamic instrumentation of compiled code</h2>

    <p>
      Andrew Werner is a co-founder of Data Ex Machina where he's
      working to bring dynamic instrumentation to your daily life with
      <a href="https://side-eye.io/">Side-Eye</a>. Before the current
      adventure, Andrew spread the good word about transactions while
      working as a software engineer on CockroachDB; there he
      contributed in a variety of areas including replication,
      transactions, changefeeds, and all things schema related.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      In this talk he'll explore different approaches to userspace
      dynamic instrumentation of compiled code. The talk will compare
      overheads and operational details between traditional debuggers
      (ptrace), eBPF uprobes, and an alternative userspace-driven
      technology.

      Research. He's been at MongoDB for almost 13 years, and he's
      changed teams, programming languages, and offices many times,
      but never his hairstyle.

      efforts on discovering and building predictive models to address
      inefficiencies across the data platform. Previously, he built
      predictive solutions to manage revenue and costs across the full
      product suite while at AWS. Matthieu lives in NYC and holds
      graduate degrees in Applied Maths from Ecole Centrale Paris and
      Analytics from MIT.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
      MongoDB is currently developing a predictive auto-scaling
      algorithm for our fleet of half a million database servers,
      which run in three public clouds and serve tens of thousands of
      customers. Each customer's demand varies dramatically over
      time, following cyclical patterns or not, leading to periods of
      over- and under-utilization. Our algorithm predicts customers'
      demand based on past patterns and recent trends, then scales
      resources in advance of changes in demand. When it works well,
      predictive auto-scaling prevents overloads, saves money for us
      and our customers, and reduces our carbon footprint. But if the
      algorithm makes a mistake, it can be very costly. We will
      describe MongoDB's predictive auto-scaling algorithm, the
      machine learning techniques involved, which methods worked well
      and which haven't, and how we plan to safely deploy such a
      risky system.

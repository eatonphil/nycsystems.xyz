    <h1>January 15th, 2026 Talks</h1>

    <p>
      We are excited to announce the first night of talks in the NYC
      Systems series in 2026! Talks are agnostic of language,
      framework, operating system, etc. And they are focused on
      engineering challenges, not product pitches.

      We are pleased to have Yihao Sun and Peter Boncz speak, and
      glad to have Trail of Bits as a partner for the venue.
